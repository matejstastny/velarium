This version should change nothing in the modpack, it just changes everything about how it is managed.

## `New things:`

- Migrated from a modpack manager [`packwiz`](https://packwiz.infra.link/) to a new one [`azalea`](https://github.com/matejstastny/azalea)
- Completely rewrote the README
- Added a new GitHub release action
